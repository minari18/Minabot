# TestBot0418
Multifunctional discord bot I made as a personal project. It includes python programming, SQLite3 database managing, and the use of the openAI API.

Main Features:
- YouTube music integration (via yt_dlp & ffmpeg)
- Genshin Impact gacha system replica
- AI-generated replies powered by OpenAI

All genshin characters art belong to Hoyoverse. ffmpeg needs to be integrated into the project's directory to be able to use the play youtube music feature.
